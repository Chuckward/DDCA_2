\begin{qa}
  \question{How did you configure the trigger for the above measurement? If it
    is clear from a screenshot, you may answer with a figure.} \answer{...}

\end{qa}

\begin{qa}
  \question{Does the SignlTap LA provide corresponding acquisition modes for
    each acquisition mode of the Agilent LA in the lab?
    What are the differences?}
  \answer{...}
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}
  \question{What resources on the FPGA and board do you need to perform a
    measurement with the Agilent LA and what for the SignalTap LA?}
  \answer{...}
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}
  \question{(For SignalTap only.) Assuming you need a very low sampling frequency
    $f_s$ to capture a long time window.
    How would you define a trigger that reliably stops acquisition when a glitch
    of length $f_s^{-1}/10$ occurs on a signal (Hint: You can assume the glitch
    is long enough to serve as a valid clock pulse for a flip flop.
    Also, you may ignore synchronization issues.)?}
  \answer{...}
