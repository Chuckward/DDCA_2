Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Warning (276027): Inferred dual-clock RAM node "textmode_controller_1c:textmode_inst|video_ram:video_ram_inst|ram_rtl_0" from synchronous design logic.  The read-during-write behavior of a dual-clock RAM is undefined and may not match the behavior of the original design.
Warning (276020): Inferred RAM node "fifo_1c1r1w:vga_fifo_inst|dp_ram_1c1r1w:memory_inst|ram_rtl_0" from synchronous design logic.  Pass-through logic has been added to match the read-during-write behavior of the original design.
Warning (15714): Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details
Warning (15064): PLL "pll:pll_inst|altpll:altpll_component|pll_altpll:auto_generated|pll1" output port clk[0] feeds output pin "vga_clk_out~output" via non-dedicated routing -- jitter performance depends on switching rate of other design elements. Use PLL dedicated clock outputs to ensure jitter performance
Warning (169177): 6 pins must meet Altera requirements for 3.3-, 3.0-, and 2.5-V interfaces. For more information, refer to AN 447: Interfacing Cyclone IV E Devices with 3.3/3.0/2.5-V LVTTL/LVCMOS I/O Systems.
